# 🌌 CoSMOS: Controlling Semantics and Object Counts via Mean-Oriented Steering

This repository contains the official implementation of **CoSMOS**, a training-free inference-time steering method for improving **numerical fidelity** in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models such as *Stable Diffusion*. CoSMOS dynamically injects steering vectors into cross-attention layers during the early denoising steps of the generation process.

## 🔍 Motivation

Text-to-image(T2I) generation models have improved greatly and have been widely
used in many applications. However, **T2I models still encounter challenges in
accurately representing the requested number of objects in the user prompt**. In
this work, we alleviate this problem by investing an inference-time intervention
framework that injects steering vectors into the cross-attention layers of a pre-
trained Stable Diffusion model. Our approach **modulates the attention query
projections using pre-computed direction vectors, without requiring any model
fine-tuning**. To improve robustness and adaptability, we introduce a **dynamic
scaling mechanism** for the steering strength, computed from the distance and
alignment between current latent representations and a reference distribution. We
explore both **single-vector and step-wise variants** of the method and show that our
approach enhances control over object count in generated images while preserving
image fidelity. This demonstrates that inference-time steering, though simple in
implementation, can serve as an effective mechanism for improving numerical
fidelity in T2I models.
